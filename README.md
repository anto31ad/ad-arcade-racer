This repository contains all the behavioral scripts I wrote for a game demo made with the Unity game engine;

I developed this demo for a university assignment (Game Development course).

## Status

Despite the fact I initially said I would have released the demo executable after a short while after creating this repository, I ended up not doing it anymore for several reasons I won't go into.

Suffice to say, I'm not sure if and when I will release the executables, given that, as of now I have to deal with other issues.

Sorry for not keeping the promise. I will try to come back as soon as I have the chance!
